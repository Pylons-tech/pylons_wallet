*nix:

sh txutil.sh <op> <privkey> <account number> <sequence> <msg>



windows:

txutil <op> <privkey> <account number> <sequence> <msg> 



privkey is hex string, no 0x prefix

msg is filename of file containing message, as json - see included msg.json

op is either SIGN_BYTES, SIGNED_TX, or AUTO_CREATE_COOKBOOK. 
the former two need all arguments to be surprised b/c they're using the low-level interface to generate the data structures manually. 
AUTO_CREATE_COOKBOOK ignores everything after privkey, and you don't need to supply them.
