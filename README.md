# pylons_wallet
Multiplatform tools for writing Pylons wallets. pylons_wallet is a multiproject Gradle build consisting of the following:

## Subprojects

### walletcore
Core library implementing Pylons blockchain functionality and high-level abstraction layers for message-handling and UI interaction. Highly portable, enabling
wallet applications to be written for any platform with a JVM implementatiion. See also [IpcLayer/UILayer notes.](https://github.com/Pylons-tech/pylons_wallet/blob/master/walletcore/ipclayer_uilayer.md)

### devwallet
TornadoFX-driven desktop wallet application. Currently orphaned and unmaintained; doesn't build.

### devdevwallet
Minimal, console-based, proof-of-concept wallet currently used with the Pylons Unity SDK. devdevwallet doesn't possess a standalone UI - it's strictly a target for IPC clients to be written against.

### httpipc
Quick and nasty IPC using a local HTTP server, used by devdevwallet. Good for a sample implementation of an IpcLayer.

### txutil
Console tool for emitting signatures manually to be compared against values generated by the node, for debugging purposes. Also old/unmaintained/not building.
(This is an easier fix - it just needs to support multicore.)

**TODO:** Can we get an Android wallet to actually build as part of the multiproject?

## Environment

**TODO:** devwallet has a _really_ janky build process involving two separate JDKs. Is there any reason we can't migrate onto JDK 15 now?
(It might break some dependencies, but it's worth doing if at all possible.)

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [JDK 14](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk14-archive-downloads.html) (Used for running jpackage w/ JDK 11)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Pylons node and REST client](https://github.com/Pylons-tech/pylons) must be installed for walletcore tests to work as expected.

## Install

Set up the environment, clone the repository, open the project in IDEA.
**TODO: get a more detailed/useful install guide - need to actually do this on a clean VM or something first to figure out where the gotchas are**
