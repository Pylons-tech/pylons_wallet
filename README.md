# pylons_wallet
Multiplatform tools for writing Pylons wallets. pylons_wallet is a multiproject Gradle build consisting of the following:

## Subprojects

### walletcore
Core library implementing Pylons blockchain functionality and high-level abstraction layers for message-handling and UI interaction. Highly portable, enabling
wallet applications to be written for any platform with a JVM implementatiion. See also [IpcLayer/UILayer notes.](https://github.com/Pylons-tech/pylons_wallet/blob/master/walletcore/ipclayer_uilayer.md)

### devwallet
TornadoFX-driven desktop wallet application. Currently orphaned and unmaintained; doesn't build.

### devdevwallet
Minimal, console-based, proof-of-concept wallet currently used with the Pylons Unity SDK. devdevwallet doesn't possess a standalone UI - it's strictly a target for IPC clients to be written against.

### httpipc
Quick and nasty IPC using a local HTTP server, used by devdevwallet. Good for a sample implementation of an IpcLayer.

### androidipc
IPCLayer implementation for Android.

### txutil
Console tool for emitting signatures manually to be compared against values generated by the node, for debugging purposes. Also old/unmaintained/not building.
(This is an easier fix - it just needs to support multicore.)

**TODO:** Can we get an Android wallet to actually build as part of the multiproject?

## Environment

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
- [JDK 15](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Pylons node and REST client](https://github.com/Pylons-tech/pylons) must be installed for walletcore tests to work as expected.

## Install

Set up the environment, clone the repository, open the project in IDEA.

Create a file called local.properties in the root pylons_wallet directory (if it doesn't already exist) and add the following line to it:

`sdk.dir=YOUR_ANDROID_SDK_PATH_HERE`

where YOUR_ANDROID_SDK_PATH_HERE is the local directory Android SDKs are stored in on your system.

**TODO: get a more detailed/useful install guide - need to actually do this on a clean VM or something first to figure out where the gotchas are**
